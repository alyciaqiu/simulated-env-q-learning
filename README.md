# Q-Learning for Optimal Execution in a Simulated Environment

This is a code repository for my paper: _Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Execution: Training Q-Learning Agents in a Simulated Environment_.

## Overview
 In this project, I trained a Q-learning agent in a simulated environment that
 is based on the Almgren-Chriss Model. The goal of this project is train the agent
 to find the optimal policy to liquidate 10 shares of stock over a horizon T=5 in an
 unknown environment. Comparing to the two naive strategies: (1) executing with a
 constant trading speed, and (2) executing everything at time 0, the Q-learning agent
 show betters performance especially when encounters a more complicated market.
